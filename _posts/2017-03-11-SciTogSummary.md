## #SciTog Summary

![A perfect unconference starts with perfect cupcakes](/assets/starting.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


### Why #SciTog

Since I finished my PhD I worked in various large e-infrastructure projects
which aimed to build bridges between various research sub-disciplines within the
solar system. All these projects were doing a great job for researchers in one
area to know the effects (or the source) in a different place. That helps a lot
to get the bigger picture and to find out interesting events in an easier manner
than before. However, I think that's just the beginning. A researcher
specialised in one area may not understand exactly what's happening in a
different one. We were helping the researchers to discover data in other areas
but not to connect them with the experts in these areas. 

Because my involvement in open source projects and online communities like
software carpentry I knew such a thing was possible with the current tools
available. But, why were we not using them? That thought embarked me in this
adventure, which is not finished, but its first chapter has just concluded.

### Organisation
     
As part of my fellowship I organised an un-conference to discuss the
possibilities, the barriers and the tools when working with people that are
not sharing the same office or institute. (What?! do you there's no need
because e-mail solves any situation? Don't get me started... well, let me
tell you...) Yes, I drove the un-conference a bit "against" e-mail. But not
because I think it's evil (yes, I do a little bit) but - as one of the
participant said in the survey for booth, the good and bad - everyone uses
it, and as such everyone has something to comment about it.

I didn't want the participants of the unconference just being researchers,
neither just savvy technological collaborative people. Otherwise there were
not going too much to learn from. So I started inviting key people from
different domains: researchers, open source developers, online community
members, online artists, collaborative service providers and, more
importantly, librarians! Unfortunately not everyone could attend but the
group that come was varied enough to spark some knowledge transfer and
draw some conclusions about certain topics.

![What is the people using?](/assets/cloudlogo.png){:class="img-responsive"}

There were 32 registered participants (and only 6 didn't show up!!), they
were asked at registration few questions like what collaborative tools they
use and to say one good and one bad thing about email. With the list of
tools I created a cloud logo (shown in the image) with size weighted by
their mentions. On the good vs bad comments received about email they could
be classified as being popular, easy to use, you control its management and
it is free as good things whereas the complains grouped into thinks like
they are a source of spam, it's easy to get unmanageable threads, its
misuse (attachments, meaningless subject lines, ...) and popularity.

On e-mail defence, I must say that we could get similar comments about any tool
out there that's used, even more if these uses are beyond what they were created
for. To level the field (or as I would say in Spanish, to level the balance)
first thing I asked to the participants was to introduce themselves and either
said the think the love of their less favourite tool or what they hate of their
most favourite. Funny enough, most of the people decided to complain
about [their favourite tool](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SciTog). It
was surprising for me to listen that tools like google docs were difficult to
use for some people and that I'm not the only one to have a personas crisis
between work and personal accounts with many different identities online.
     
I set up different tools to register the evolution of the conference, that
included: a channel for chatting connecting IRC, `[matrix]`, slack and Gitter; a
set of [etherpads](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SciTog) linked with
discussion topics and summaries of what's being discussed;
a [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/sciencetogether) team to collect papers
and blogs; and a group
in [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/groups/m7Ro76d8/sciencetogether) to record
the annotations on websites that we might have done during the two days. The
etherpads were the winner of them all! Even when the use of other collaborative
editing tools were encouraged. Sadly I didn't ask how many people didn't know
about etherpads before, happily I know now that 25 people know about it!

After the introductions, we started with our first keynote: [Kim Nilsson](https://twitter.com/kimknilsson),
CEO of [Pivigo](https://www.pivigo.com/), telling us how to "Set your (data) scientist free!". Her
company provides a service of data scientist teams that work remotely, 
and she explained how they've managed to do so, which tools they use and which
rules they follow. In (very)short this was by following the next steps:
 - Daily scrum meetings.
 - Daily video Q&A session (with a moderator controlling everyone talks).
 - Weekly social get-together where everyone brings a drink (weird at first).
 - Let the other people when you are away.
She was asked few questions afterwards about remote teams working at very
different time-zones, to which in her experience only happened one and the
person adapted the others team member time zone.

The unconference followed up with a
[session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XNNgN6zCK9JtCkkRK2_CCEGZ2exFADc7cmxUGsoACaY/edit?usp=sharing)
lead by my other two important guests, [Bianca](https://twitter.com/MsPhelps)
and [Jeroen](https://twitter.com/jeroenbosman) - the Utrecht University
librarians behind
[600+ list of tools for scholarly communication](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/).
They made us think on how many tools we use and write them down, then link them
if they integrated with others. They introduced their analysis of workflows
between different tools and some other results from their analysis. We then went
trough an exercise to
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z9PDiHMvXrw0bJUMtnRkC0UgOq1P-NI8Q_8reJ3DBb4/edit?usp=sharing) 
and discuss the no-go or attractiveness on any tool we aim to use.
     
Finally the last session of the day started as a free will with a [speedblogging
activity](/blog/categories/#speedblogging). Where different topics where discussed:
- [People barriers](/blog/people_barriers.html)
- [Issues and solutions in convincing people to select, adopt, and use certain collaboration tools](/blog/convincing-people.html)
- [What goes into a guide to doing open science?](/blog/openscience.html)
- [Legal barriers to collaborative open research - the gap between policies and practice](/blog/legasl_barriers.html)
- [Activation barriers to new tools](/blog/activation-barriers.html)

![Whiteboard and SSI](/assets/whiteboards.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The second day was complete free-will unconference of three 1.5-hour
sessions where the last 10 minutes we were meeting all together and discuss
what has been discuss. All the discussions were too recorded in etherpads and
available now [from the website of the conference](/results/).

With all that the 2-day unconference finished, probably with the conclusion
that we won't be email free but with a lot of resources and options that
we can start to apply in our everyday life to ease our collaborations. And
that's good, because I don't want Science Together ending here! The
resources are available online for everyone and they can be updated by
anyone. Let's hope there will be a #SciTog2!

As a final but not less important note, we got almost a perfect gender equality
participation during both days!! That was not easy, but not impossible!
