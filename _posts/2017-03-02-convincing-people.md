## Introduction

We are all aware that some research groups are still using very inefficient
tools while collaborating. It is true that some of the tools are suitable for
some in the group but not for the others.

The collaboration tools sometimes may also have a huge knowledge barrier which
intimidates the collaborators. Over and over again, we experience huge
difficulties, when we try to push forward a better collaboration solution. It is
a common problem happening almost everywhere. We would like to propose a **sample
procedure** on how to convince people and let people to adopt certain
collaboration tools.
    
## Issues

When selecting collaboration tools for a project and/or research collaboration,
different stakeholders typically have different preferences and priorities.
Researchers, developers, PIs and project managers may prefer to use completely
different tools for sharing data, write collaborative documents, or to
communicate. What typically happens in these situations is **one or the other
party forcing its preference and opinion** on the others. Strangely, this is many
times the developers/researchers achieving to use more complex or technical
tools. The outcome is in many cases devastating people ending up **quietly
boycotting** the selected tools or starting to use alternative solutions. The
question is how to avoid or resolve such situations and come up with a solution
that results in utilizing efficient and effective tools that are accepted by all
parties.

## Crucial steps in the convincing process

In successfully convincing people to switch their way of working or start using
a new or different tool there are a few crucial steps. First you need to have
**some explicit consensus/agreement that is is worthwhile to look at some
alternatives to facilitate collaboration**. If there are people not willing to
subscribe even to that idea, that you may have a problem that you need to solve
before you move on. Perhaps you should make clear that it may involve comprising
on some aspects to make collaboration possible. 

Next you need to have an **open discussion/session showing and demonstrating the
advantages** of the new tool. That has to be honest, **not ignoring problems or
disadvantages**, but of course being clear on how it fosters collaboration and
by doing that improve outcomes/products. Having people look at product created
by other with that tool might help. Also being able to collectively play around
with the tool with some supervision/help in an early phase is important. Another
thing that is important in some cases is look at how the tools/solutions might
also help people with other projects they are doing, so try to know a bit about
the background of the collaborators.

Then you need to move on and perhaps have a **democratic decision making process**
that could include voting. You could consider doing that in several rounds:
vote, have another session trying out the tools or discussing it and then vote
again. Only if there is a large majority voting for the tools decide to use it,
but still **pay attention to the people that voted against** or abstained. After the
decision to work in a certain way there should be **easy access to training &
support**. Finally **monitor what is happening**, are people starting to use that way
of working?
