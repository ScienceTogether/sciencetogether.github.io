We talked about reasons why that make you not interested to learn a new tools
that someone suggested you to give a try or was imposed to you learn for any
reason. From our discussion we noticed that most of the reasons are related with
the notion of trade of for the investment, freedom, support/training and
features.

In terms of investment, we found that often the choice of the product is made
not so much around the actual product but more how well known the company is.
This could mean that smaller companies, although they might offer the 'better',
i.e. more suitable product, will be excluded as they are not that well known.
There seems to be a general trend of 'well known = good'. As a consequence of
that money can be wasted as a more expensive but less suitable product might be
selected.

In term of freedom, we, as human beings, don't want to be told want we must do
or use and sometimes this is a hide reason to not adopted a tool. Policy makers
could avoid go with top-down decisions without talking with the groups that will
most be effected by the change of tool. We recommend that only one change be
done per time and give enough time between two changes so that users can get
comfortable with the new tool. In this case, changes in procedures at the same
time of changes on tools can make the transition harder. In addition, have a
good standardisation of procedures will help to know who is going to be effected
by the migration which can help to query with those or prepare for offer
training, which will discussed in the next paragraph.

In regards to Training, both for new as well as established products, we talked
about the importance of having a "chat " type training and response options
available for quick turnaround on issues as well as easy interaction with the
vendor. Important also that products are not to complicated that long/ in depth
training courses need to be done ( which also can be expensive) . This in turn
takes us to the issue of some users also not wanting to learn or use new
products because they are simply used to and prefer using what the know well and
are comfortable with. .

In terms of features, if some users will suffer of feature regression they will
push against learn the new tool with good reasons. If the new tool is able to
downgrade to previous version, offers interoperability with the previous tool or
support custom GUI's the users could me less worry to give the new tool a try.
Features

Our conclusion was that people will have many different reasons not to want to
learn any new tool, specially when imposed to do it, but change tools will
always happen even if we would love to stay with the tools that we have today so
follow some of our suggestions could at least result in less push backs from
your community.
