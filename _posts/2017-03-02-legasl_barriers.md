Through our discussion we have identified barriers to collaborative include
institutional policy & lack of understand re: policies and 'open' in addition to
the legal constraints.

This manifests itself through:

- unclear policy and contradictory advice - grey areas, unclear definitions of
  research outputs and what is covered by a specific policy
- getting into trouble for doing the 'right thing' 
- fudging for compliance - tools available don't always fit requirements to be
  legally compliant, tools have to used and combined in weird ways to get jobs done
- 'just put it out there' - breaking the rules feels like the right thing to do - when draconian
- data sharing agreements - data management plans, not always completed and not always realised needed


These are caused by a combination of lack of understanding of open licences and
what 'open' means (especially by senior management and legal services), which
leads to the questions including:

- how do you educate about 'open' and sharing? Especially seeing as researchers
  already do not (want to) understand copyright for "classical" research outputs
  such as journal articles which is e.g. [why they use ResearchGate](http://fossilsandshit.com/illegal-file-hosting-site-researchgate-acquires-massive-financial-investment/)
- is code a research output or software produced for work? - grey & unclear in
  IPR documents, unclear definitions of research outputs and what is covered by
  a specific policy
- can I contribute to open source projects? - lack of legal right to contribute
  code to open source projects due to not owing the IP of the work
