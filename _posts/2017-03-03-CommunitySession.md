## Issues that came up in the discussion:
    
- Time zones for international projects are difficult 
- Communication needs to be consistent or things get messy
- Paid or unpaid work?
- Setting expectations: response times, tool availability, etc
- Clear instructions of where things are (e.g documentation, meeting notes, â€¦)
- Get the community to teach each other: building strength and sustainability
  through numbers, i.e. break a job down into small bits so the individual
  workload is small but combined effort delivers results; several people do the
  same thing, so that if one person suddenly leaves for whatever reason, you
  have some redundancy to tide you over

## TIPS:

-  Be present
-  Be open-minded
-  Talk to people - but be aware that some people need formality and others need
   the opposite to thrive and feel comfortable to contribute
-  Allow lots of freedom in how things are done (focus more on outcomes than process)
-  Involve community in facilitation, designs, platform/tool choices etc
-  Community events (online/offline/blended) and competitions
-  Room for playfulness and experimentation
-  If you do meet online regularly, vary the times to allow everyone around the
   world to participate, but be clear where notes and meeting dates are stored
-  Build a small reliable core team that helps co-ordinate the next level of
   contributors/helpers/participants (whatever you call them in your project)
