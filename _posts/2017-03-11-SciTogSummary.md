## #SciTog Summary

![A perfect unconference starts with perfect cupcakes](/assets/starting.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


### Why #SciTog

Since I finished my PhD, I've worked on various large e-infrastructure projects
which aimed to build bridges between various research sub-disciplines within 
solar system physics. All these projects were doing a great job for researchers in one
area to know the effects (or the source) in a different place. That helps a lot
to get the bigger picture and to find out interesting events in an easier manner
than before. However, I think that's just the beginning. A researcher
specialised in one area may not understand exactly what's happening in a
different one. We were helping researchers to discover data in other domains
but not to connect them with the experts in those areas. 

Due to my involvement in open source projects and online communities like
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) I knew such a thing was possible with the current tools
available. But, why were we not using them? That thought embarked me on this
adventure, which is not finished, but its first chapter has just concluded.

### Getting there...
     
As part of my [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) Fellowship, 
I organised "Science Together", an un-conference to discuss the
possibilities, the barriers and the tools when working with people that don't
share the same office or institute. (What?! Do you think there's no need
because e-mail solves any situation? Don't get me started! Well, let me
tell you...) Yes, I drove the un-conference a bit "against" e-mail. But not
because I think it's evil (yes, I do a little bit) but -- as one of the
participants said in the survey for booth, the good and bad - everyone uses
it, and as such everyone has something to comment about it.

I didn't want the participants of the unconference just being researchers,
neither just savvy technological collaborative people. Otherwise, there wasn't
going too much to learn from. So I started inviting key people from
different domains: researchers, open source developers, online community
members, online artists, collaborative service providers and, more
importantly, librarians! Unfortunately not everyone could attend but the
group that did was varied enough to spark some knowledge transfer and
draw some conclusions about certain topics.

### The un-conference

There were 32 registered participants (and only six didn't show up!!). They
were asked at registration few questions like what collaborative tools they
use and to say one good and one bad thing about email. With the list of
tools I created a cloud with logos (shown in the image) size-weighted by
their mentions. Regarding the good vs bad comments received about e-mail,  it could
be classified as being popular, easy to use, you control its management and
it is free as good things whereas the complains grouped into things like
they are a source of spam, it's easy to get unmanageable threads, its
misuse (attachments, meaningless subject lines, ...) and popularity.

On the defence of e-mail, we could get similar comments about any tool
out there, even more if its uses go beyond what they were created
for. To level the field (or as I would say in Spanish, to level the balance)
first thing I asked to the participants was to introduce themselves and either
say what they love of their least favourite tool or what they hate of their
most favourite. Funny enough, most of the people decided to complain
about [their favourite tool](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SciTog). It
was surprising for me to listen that tools like Google Docs were difficult to
use for some people and that I'm not the only one to have a personas crisis
between work and personal accounts with many different online identities.
     
I set up different tools to register the evolution of the conference, that
included: a channel for chatting connecting IRC, `[matrix]`, Slack and Gitter; a
set of [etherpads](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SciTog) linked to
discussion topics and summaries of discussions;
a [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/sciencetogether) team to collect papers
and blogs; and a group
on [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/groups/m7Ro76d8/sciencetogether) to record
the annotations on websites that we might have done during the two days. The
etherpads were the winner of them all! Even when the use of other collaborative
editing tools was encouraged. Sadly, I didn't ask how many people didn't know
about etherpads before; happily I know now that 25 people know about it!

After the introductions, we started with our first keynote: [Kim Nilsson](https://twitter.com/kimknilsson),
CEO of [Pivigo](https://www.pivigo.com/), telling us how to "Set your (data) scientist free!". Her
company provides a service of data scientist teams that work remotely, 
and she explained how they've managed to do so, which tools they use and which
rules they follow. In (very) short, they follow these steps:
 - daily online scrum meetings;
 - daily Q&A session video call (with a moderator controlling everyone engages);
 - weekly social get-togethers video call where everyone brings a drink (weird at first);
 - let other people know when you're away.

Kim got a few questions afterwards about remote teams working at very
different time-zones, to which she replied that in her experience it's only happened once and the
person adapted to the team's time zone.

The unconference followed up with a
[session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XNNgN6zCK9JtCkkRK2_CCEGZ2exFADc7cmxUGsoACaY/edit?usp=sharing)
led by my other two important guests, [Bianca](https://twitter.com/MsPhelps)
and [Jeroen](https://twitter.com/jeroenbosman) - the Utrecht University
librarians behind
[600+ list of tools for scholarly communication](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/).
They made us think on how many tools we use and asked us to write them down, then link them
if they were integrated with others. They introduced their analysis of workflows
between different tools and some other results from their analysis. We then went
through an exercise to
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z9PDiHMvXrw0bJUMtnRkC0UgOq1P-NI8Q_8reJ3DBb4/edit?usp=sharing) 
and discuss the no-go or attractiveness of any tool we aim to use.
     
Finally, the last session of the day started as a free will with a [speedblogging
activity](/blog/categories/#speedblogging). Where different topics were discussed:
- [People barriers](/blog/people_barriers.html)
- [Issues and solutions in convincing people to select, adopt, and use certain collaboration tools](/blog/convincing-people.html)
- [What goes into a guide to doing open science?](/blog/openscience.html)
- [Legal barriers to collaborative open research - the gap between policies and practice](/blog/legasl_barriers.html)
- [Activation barriers to new tools](/blog/activation-barriers.html)

The second day was complete free-will unconference of three 1.5-hour
sessions when for the last ten minutes we reconvened and discussed
what had been discussed. All the discussions were recorded in etherpads and
are available now [at the conference website](/results/).

With all that the 2-day unconference finished, probably with the conclusion
that we won't be email free but with a lot of resources and options that
we can start to apply in our everyday life to ease our collaborations. And
that's good, because I don't want Science Together ending here! The
resources are available online for everyone and they can be updated by
anyone. Let's hope there will be a #SciTog2!

As a final but not less important note, we got almost a perfect gender equality
participation during both days!! That was not easy, but not impossible!
