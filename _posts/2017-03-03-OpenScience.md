## Notes

We discussed what's important in fostering the adoption of open science
practices, in some way furthering thought of one of the [Thurday's speed blogs](http://sciencetogether.online/blog/openscience.html)

Daniel showed the approach he entered as [an answer to a question on the Open
Science Q&A platform](https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de/1001/how-do-we-encourage-the-doubtful-to-try-open-research)

Using [that platform in itself](https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de) might be a
good idea to focuss and collect questions and answers and it can be used for
education and outreach purposes as well.

We shared some ideas of different groups working on the idea of using decision
trees (tools/software) to guide people in adopting practices. The Force11
community is working on that in [the context of developing a scholarly commons]
(https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group) and
Wellcome/Glopid-R are looking into it specifically for [sharing data in health
emergencies]
