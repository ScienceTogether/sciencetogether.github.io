## What we want?

After [madeye](/tools/madeye.html) disappeared, we are in despair to use something 
that allows you to program with people who is not physically with you.
There's [gobi](/tools/gobby) which is like a non web browser based version of etherpad.
That could be used for pair programming as it offers syntax highlighting 
and sharing multiple files. There are also a couple of alternatives
for atom users... but none of us are using atom.

### Presenting [Floobits](http://floobits.com)

Stuart googling just after we started floobits. We've spent then the whole time
playing with it, and got a 
[few information on the website about it](/tools/floobits.html).

This non-free tool allows us to use our favourite editor (or directly from the
browser!), connect with a git repository, share a terminal together with a video
conference integration and IRC.
