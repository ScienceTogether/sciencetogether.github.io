    <p>
        An unconference about <b>collaborative tools</b>
        - <i> which tools? which rules?</i>.
        We will discuss what are the secrets to use them
        successfully in a scientific environment.<br>
        Which problems do we encounter? is it a problem
        with the tools? is it a generational barrier?
        or there are governamental rules that prevent us
        to use them?

        * If the above is not enough reason to come, here are some more:
        <ul>
            <li> Because people overuse of e-mail. Wait, I've said that already; </li>
            <li> To understand which legal issues prevent you using cloud solutions that host data in a different country;</li>
            <li> To identify and overcome barriers to collaboration created by certain tools;</li>
            <li> To recognise which workflows are more suitable to remote collaborations;</li>
            <li> To debate which etiquettes we (should) follow when working online; </li>
            <li> And of course, to discuss the <a href="/tools">tools</a> available and look to the future!</li>

        </ul>
    Take a look at the <b><a href="/tools">tools</a></b> and
    <a href="https://github.com/ScienceTogether/tools">suggest new ones</a>
