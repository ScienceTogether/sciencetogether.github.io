## Conclusions

We will not be email free. :-( Filters and labels can help you manage your inbox
in a more sane way. If you want to access all your account from one place you
can use one desktop client or you can setup redirect for your web clients. At
the end, most of the email inconveniences is a cultural problem instead of a
technical problem. Some of this can be resolved by setting expectations of what
email is to be used for and expected turnaround time for response, good for new
projects or collaborations but this can be time consuming and difficult when a
culture is already embedded. Solve the cultural problem is another discussion
since we can end up in requiring new collaborators to read 1k pages of
procedures.
